# My Learning Journey with Scikit-Learn  This repository is a personal learning space where I explore **machine learning basics** using [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).   I run experiments in Jupyter Notebook, and whenever I hit errors, I switch to Python scripts to debug and fix them.   It’s not a polished project — it’s my hands-on practice and notes as I grow in ML.  ---  ## 📂 Files Overview

File

Purpose

.gitignore

Keeps unnecessary files out of version control.

data.csv

Dataset used for testing models and preprocessing steps.

errorFix.py

Python script where I debug errors from the notebook.

requirements.txt

Dependencies needed to run the notebook and scripts.

sklTest.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook with my Scikit-Learn experiments and practice runs.

🚀 How to Use

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook sklTest.ipynb

🧪 What I’m Practicing

Loading and exploring datasets (data.csv).

Preprocessing data (scaling, encoding, splitting).

Training simple models with Scikit-Learn.

Debugging errors by moving code into errorFix.py.

📌 Notes

This repo is a learning session, not a finished project.Expect trial-and-error, fixes, and experiments as I continue exploring ML concepts.

🎯 Next Steps

Try different ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering).

Document common errors and fixes.

Add more datasets for practice.

🤝 Contributions

This is mainly for my personal learning, but if you have tips or suggestions, feel free to share!


Would you like me to make the tone even more **casual and diary-like** (like “Day 1: tried linear regression, got errors 😅”) or keep it **semi-professional** so it looks good if someone stumbles on your repo?
