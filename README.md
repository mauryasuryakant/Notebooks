> A personal learning repository exploring machine learning fundamentals with **Scikit-Learn** through hands-on experiments and debugging

---

## 📋 Overview

This repository is my **personal learning space** where I dive into machine learning basics using Scikit-Learn. I document my journey, experiments, and the problems I encounter along the way. When I hit errors in Jupyter Notebooks, I debug them using Python scripts to understand what went wrong.

> **Note:** This is a work-in-progress learning project, not a polished product. Expect experimentation, iteration, and continuous growth! 🌱
