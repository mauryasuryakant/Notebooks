My Learning Journey with Scikit-Learn
My Learning Journey with Scikit-Learn
This repository is a personal learning space where I explore machine learning basics using Scikit-Learn.
I run experiments in Jupyter Notebook, and whenever I hit errors, I switch to Python scripts to debug and fix them.
It’s not a polished project — it’s my hands-on practice and notes as I grow in ML.
----------------------------------------
📂 Files Overview
File	Purpose
.gitignore	Keeps unnecessary files out of version control.
data.csv	Dataset used for testing models and preprocessing steps.
errorFix.py	Python script where I debug errors from the notebook.
requirements.txt	Dependencies needed to run the notebook and scripts.
sklTest.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook with my Scikit-Learn experiments and practice runs.
----------------------------------------
🚀 How to Use
1.	
Clone the repo:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2.	
Install dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	
Open the notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook sklTest.ipynb

----------------------------------------
🧪 What I’m Practicing
•	Loading and exploring datasets (data.csv).
•	Preprocessing data (scaling, encoding, splitting).
•	Training simple models with Scikit-Learn.
•	Debugging errors by moving code into errorFix.py.
----------------------------------------
📌 Notes
This repo is a learning session, not a finished project.
Expect trial-and-error, fixes, and experiments as I continue exploring ML concepts.
----------------------------------------
🎯 Next Steps
•	Try different ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering).
•	Document common errors and fixes.
•	Add more datasets for practice.
