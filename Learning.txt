Supervised learning uses labeled data to map inputs to known outputs, enabling precise classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., price forecasting).


Unsupervised learning analyzes unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns, such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection (fraud), and dimensionality reduction.
